# Background

To assure that manufacturing technologies work well together and with existing manufacturing systems, it is critical that manufacturers and solution providers collaborate to identify problem areas and pool solutions and best practices. The proposed Manufacturing Knowledge Base (MfgKB) provides a framework to support this collaboration. The goal of the MfgKB is to define the requirements for data-driven decision making in manufacturing. Based on these activities, key barriers are identified as well as examples of technologies and standards that have the potential to overcome these barriers.

The MfgKB Framework categorizes requirements for data-driven decision making around seven basic Functions (or activities) that occur once the purpose or goal of a decision has been well understood. These Functions are: Scope, Identify, Collect, Transmit, Analyze, Share, and Retrieve. See the [Framework](Framework.xlsx) for further description of each Function. Each Function is subdivided into Categories and Subcategories, which provide more detailed requirements required to achieve the particular Function. Examples of key Barriers and Enabling Solutions are then provided for each detailed Subcategory of requirements.
